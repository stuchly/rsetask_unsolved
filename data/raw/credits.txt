The cells were derived from dissociated human tumors and peripheral blood stained with a T cell-centric mass cytometry antibody panel. The data was originally published as Figure 1A-B of Simonds et al JITC (2021). See https://github.com/esimonds/PhenoSOM/wiki/Running-the-FR-FCM-Z3HK-demo for more details. These files were exported from http://flowrepository.org/experiments/3636 which contains additional FCS files from these same human tumor samples stained with an alternative antibody panel.
